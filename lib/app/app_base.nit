# Most users of _app.nit_ need only to implement `on_create` to setup the application.

# On mobile devices, the application can be stopped a anytime when another application takes the foreground.
# Implement the callbacks `on_save_state` and `on_load_state` to keep the state of the application between execution,
# for an illusion of continuous execution.
