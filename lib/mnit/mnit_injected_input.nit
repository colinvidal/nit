# Injection of input events that are read frm a file.
# This cloud be used to replay an execution of a mnit application to debug or to benchmark it.
#
# The input file is given through the environment variable `MNIT_READ_INPUT`
#
# In order to reproduce executions, the behavior of the application must be deterministic
# for a given sequence of inputs.
# The main source of differences in executions is caused by the `rand` function,
# Set the environment variable `NIT_SRAND` to a value to force srand to be initialized with this value.
#
# The input event file is made of event descriptions, one event by line.
#
# ~~~raw
# 10 click 10.0 20.0
# 20 quit
# ~~~
#
# The first field, an integer, is the delay (in frame count) since the previous event
# 0 means the event is launched in the same frame that the previous one.
#
# The second field, a string, is the kind of the event.
# Currently only `click` for PointerEvent and `quit` for QuitEvent are recognized.
#
# The following fields are the arguments that specific for each kind of event.
#
# * `quit` does not have arguments
# * `click` has 2 float arguments: `PointerEvent::x` and `PointerEvent::y`
